## Summary
After analyzing the temperature data, I believe a surf shop would be successful year-round in Oahu. The average temperatures for June and December are very close. The data shows that the temperature does not drastically change in Oahu year-round. Two additional queries that would support this data would be histograms for June and December. This would verify that Oahu would be an ideal location for a surf shop year-round.
